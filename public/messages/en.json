      "p1": "Hi, I’m Alexei — a frontend developer with 3+ years of experience crafting modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.",
      "p2": "I specialize in React and its ecosystem, using tools like Next.js, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Tailwind, and component libraries such as shadcn/ui, Ant Design, Material UI, and Radix UI. I care about clean design, smooth UX, and accessibility — whether it's building themeable interfaces with next-themes, localized apps with next-intl and i18next, or adding meaningful motion with Framer Motion.",
      "p3": "I also work with charts (Nivo, Recharts), integrate with APIs (REST/RPC via fetch or axios), and build blockchain-enabled interfaces using Web3.js, viem, LedgerHQ, and BigNumber.js. Performance and scalability are key, so I rely on modern tools like Vite and RSBuild for fast builds and solid architecture.",
      "p4": "I enjoy turning ideas into polished, interactive products — always with attention to detail and a user-first approach."
